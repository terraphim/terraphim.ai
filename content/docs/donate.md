This is the beginning of an exciting great new journey: support open-source projects by donating or contributing.

Terraphim AI is partially supported by Innovate UK via the Eureka funding program up to 60% of costs, under grant 600594, "ATOMIC", jointly with our collaborators [Ontola](https://ontola.io/) - the team behind [Atomic Data Server and Protocol](https://atomicdata.dev/).
But for the rest of the costs, we need your help.

# Introducing a Donation-driven roadmap

After several months of agonising over which license to release Terraphim AI under, I created a new repository with the two most liberal licenses open source MIT and APACHE2. 
We may build a commercial service on top of Terraphim Core(Cortex), but the core and our promise that it is open-sourced to allow you all to build on top of Terraphim AI, with a privacy-first, building AI tooling right way around: you don't need to move your data. You codify and move your knowledge where it needs to be and helps you to get things done the most. 

# Donation-driven roadmap
To support the project's development, we introduce a "donation-driven roadmap": if you want a feature, vote for it not only with your thumb but with your money. 
In exchange, we will be seeking your feedback on the feature implementation, and you will receive access to private repositories ahead of the public. 

Sponsor the features on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/sponsors/terraphim) or propose a new idea in [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/orgs/terraphim/discussions)
