# Terraphim Overview
**Terraphim** The purpose of the project is to build a knowledgeable personal assistant, which runs on local infrastructure and works only for the benefit of the owner.

# Why Terraphim?
**Situation**: In the current digital-first world complexity of information raises exponentially and thus requires vast amounts of knowledge to make good decisions. The ownership of personal and organisation data is given to large corporations and user needs are aggregated towards "average" or most common user, which results in degradation of overall knowledge management experience. Existing search or AI-assisted products don't have user needs at heart and not addressing individual user needs: the average user is part of the product proposition for advertisement. At the same time, personal hardware evolves the average British household has 8.5 devices in 2017, now more due to pandemics, but most of this hardware provides a marginal benefit and isn't connected into the coherent user-centric overall experience

**Individuals** can't find relevant information in different knowledge repositories: personal like Roam Research/Obsidian/Coda/Notion or team focused like Jira/Confluence/Sharepoint. There are  growing concerns about the privacy of the data and sharing individuals data across an ever-growing list of services, some of which have a questionable data ethics policy (i.e. Miro policy stated they can market any user content without permission as of Jan 2020)

# Proposal
**Terraphim** is a privacy preserving AI assistant which works for you under your full control. Staring from local search engine which can be configured to search for different types of content, such as Stackoverflow, Github, local filesystem with a pre-defined folder including Markdown Files and then take Terraphim forward to work with other user's owned content.
Use modern algorithms for AI/ML, data fusion and distributed communication techniques to run AI assistants on user's hardware.

# Name of the project
Inspired by Relict serios of science fiction by Vasiliy Golovachev, where terraphim is a artificial intelligence (ink) living inside space suite (part of exocortex).

# Roadmap 
## First release in two weeks by 20 February 2022 - Minimal Usable Product
Aimed at developers and engineers: Local search which depending on settings "Role" changes the default search behaviour, roles can be Developer, Engineer, Architect, Father, Gamer. First release will be shipped with Role Developer default search behaviour: returns results from stackoverflow, github, local filesystem with a pre-defined folder including search over Markdown Files.
