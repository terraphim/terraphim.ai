# Terraphim Overview
**Terraphim** The purpose of the project is to build a knowledgeable personal assistant, which runs on local infrastructure and works only for the benefit of the owner.

# Long term

If you are a Tim Ferris fan, Terraphim is built to help you:  AI assistants working for you, like in Ramith Seti in an interview with Tim Ferris, 2019: “By the time I start working, I am opening my calendar, double click on hour, usually writing, and everything is ready - the document is ready to go, with the exact type of information I need. Everything is properly organized, there is nothing left to chance, there is nothing like one document here one document there, it’s all in its place. 
Q: Do you prepare it in advance?
R: my assistant has, my team has. It’s all been properly engineered: the best morning routine is decided the day before the week before the year before. By the time I get there, it’s all ready to go. It’s like a chef working.
On the day to day basis, things like scheduling:  even going here, when I was getting Uber, I didn’t even know which airport I was going to, I know when I double click my calendar it’s all will be there and it’s all have been taken care for.
When I travel, especially for long periods of time, Gill my assistant activated travel protocol: my plants get watered while I am away, she handles emails in a different way, which means all those details I attend when I am in the office now attended by someone else”. Terraphim(s) are those convenient AI assistants caring only for you. I can't hire assistants to all knowledge workers out there, but I can build AI assistant to help individuals. 
# Why Terraphim?
**Situation**: In the current digital-first world complexity of information raises exponentially and thus requires vast amounts of knowledge to make good decisions. The ownership of personal and organisation data is given to large corporations and user needs are aggregated towards "average" or most common user, which results in degradation of the overall knowledge management experience. Existing search or AI-assisted products don't have user needs at heart and not addressing individual user needs: the average user is part of the product proposition for advertisement. At the same time, personal hardware evolves the average British household has 8.5 devices in 2017, now more due to pandemics, but most of this hardware provides a marginal benefit and isn't connected to the coherent user-centric overall experience

**Individuals** can't find relevant information in different knowledge repositories: personal like Roam Research/Obsidian/Coda/Notion or team focused like Jira/Confluence/Sharepoint. There are  growing concerns about the privacy of the data and sharing individuals data across an ever-growing list of services, some of which have a questionable data ethics policy (i.e. Miro policy stated they can market any user content without permission as of Jan 2020)

# Proposal
**Terraphim** is a privacy first AI assistant which works for you under your full control. Starting from local search engine which can be configured to search for different types of content, such as Stackoverflow, Github, local filesystem with a pre-defined folder including Markdown Files and then take Terraphim forward to work with own content.
Use modern algorithms for AI/ML, data fusion and distributed communication techniques to run AI assistants on user's hardware.

# Name of the project

Inspired by the Relict serios of science fiction by Vasiliy Golovachev, where Terraphim is artificial intelligence (ink) living inside the space suite (part of exocortex).

# Roadmap 
## First release in two weeks by 20 October 2022 - Minimal Usable Product

Aimed at developers and engineers: Local search depending on settings "Role" changes the default search behaviour, roles can be Developer, Engineer, Architect, Father, Gamer. The first release will be shipped with Role Developer default search behaviour: returns results from StackOverflow, GitHub, local filesystem with a pre-defined folder including search over Markdown Files - your Obsidian Vault.

# Inspired 

Raycast, QuickSilver and Alfred
