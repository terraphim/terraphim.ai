# Overview

**Terraphim** is a knowledgeable personal assistant which runs on local infrastructure and works only for the owner's benefit.

# Proposal

**Terraphim** is a privacy-first AI assistant which works for you under your complete control. It starts as a local search engine, which can be configured to search for different types of content, such as Stackoverflow, Github, and local filesystem with a pre-defined folder including Markdown Files, take Terraphim forward to work with your content.
We use modern algorithms for AI/ML, data fusion, and distributed communication techniques to run AI assistants on the user's hardware, including not used mobile devices. 

# Why Terraphim?

**Individuals** can't find relevant information in different knowledge repositories [[1]](https://www.coveo.com/en/resources/reports/relevance-report-workplace), [[2]](https://cottrillresearch.com/various-survey-statistics-workers-spend-too-much-time-searching-for-information/), [[3]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/12/17/reality-check-still-spending-more-time-gathering-instead-of-analyzing/): personal ones like Roam Research/Obsidian/Coda/Notion, team-focused ones like Jira/Confluence/Sharepoint, or public [[4]](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/06/the-internet-is-a-collective-hallucination/619320/). There are growing concerns about the privacy of the data and sharing individuals data across an ever-growing list of services, some of which have a questionable data ethics policy (i.e., Miro policy stated they could market any user content without permission as of Jan 2020).

# We are Applied Knowledge Systems (AKS)

We have ample experience and expertise:
- Terraphim's development of the talent digital shadow functionality is funded by Innovate UK, project name "ATOMIC", TSB Project No: 600594;
- Being a 2021 platinum winner of a “Build on Redis” Hackaton by developing real-time Natural Language Processing (NLP) for medical literature to help find relevant knowledge using artificial intelligence and novel UX element, see Demo;
- Sensor fusion application from IoT devices, such as LIDAR and acoustic-based water flow sensors;
- Developing advanced operation model digital twins of networks for the aircraft for Boeing and Rolls-Royce;
- more on [our website.](https://applied-knowledge.systems/)

# Why "Terraphim"?

Alex Mikhalev was inspired by the Relict series of science fiction by Vasiliy Golovachev, where Terraphim is artificial intelligence living inside the space suite (part of an exocortex).
