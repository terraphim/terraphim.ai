# Why Terraphim?

![Terraphim Cloud system architecture.](https://github.com/terraphim/terraphim.ai/blob/main/content/static/terraphim_architecture.svg)

**Individuals** can't find relevant information in different knowledge repositories: personal like Roam Research/Obsidian/Coda/Notion or team-focused like Jira/Confluence/Sharepoint. There are  growing concerns about the privacy of the data and sharing individuals data across an ever-growing list of services, some of which have a questionable data ethics policy (i.e., Miro policy stated they could market any user content without permission as of Jan 2020)

# Proposal

**Terraphim** is a privacy-first AI assistant which works for you under your complete control. Starting from a local search engine, which can be configured to search for different types of content, such as Stackoverflow, Github, and local filesystem with a pre-defined folder including Markdown Files, take Terraphim forward to work with your content.
We use modern algorithms for AI/ML, data fusion, and distributed communication techniques to run AI assistants on the user's hardware, including not used mobile devices. 

# Applied knowledge systems (AKS)

We have ample experience and expertise:
- Terraphim's development of the talent digital shadow functionality is funded by Innovate UK, project name "ATOMIC", TSB Project No: 600594;
- Being a 2021 platinum winner of a “Build on Redis” Hackaton by developing real-time Natural Language Processing (NLP) for medical literature to help find relevant knowledge using artificial intelligence and novel UX element, see Demo;
- Sensor fusion application from IoT devices, such as LIDAR and acoustic-based water flow sensors;
- Developing advanced operation model digital twins of networks for the aircraft for Boeing and Rolls-Royce;

We successfully closed the first project period with Innovate UK. These are our lessons learned.

# Why "Terraphim"?

I was inspired by the Relict series of science fiction by Vasiliy Golovachev, where Terraphim is artificial intelligence living inside the space suite (part of an exocortex).
